# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Telegram group chat game bot that facilitates a word-building game where players take turns creating words that start with specific letters and increase in length with each round. The bot manages game state, validates words, enforces timing constraints, and tracks player turns to create an engaging group gaming experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Telegram group administrator, I want to start a word game in my group chat, so that members can participate in an interactive word-building challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends the /startgame command THEN the bot SHALL initialize a new game with a random starting letter
2. WHEN a game is started THEN the bot SHALL announce the game rules and first player's turn
3. WHEN a game is already active THEN the bot SHALL inform users that a game is in progress
4. WHEN the /startgame command is used THEN the bot SHALL set the initial word length requirement to 1

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to submit words during my turn, so that I can participate in the word game and advance the game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the bot SHALL accept word submissions from that specific player only
2. WHEN a player submits a word THEN the bot SHALL verify the word starts with the required letter
3. WHEN a player submits a word THEN the bot SHALL verify the word matches the required length
4. WHEN a player submits a valid word THEN the bot SHALL use the last letter as the next starting letter
5. WHEN a player submits a valid word THEN the bot SHALL increase the required word length by 1
6. WHEN a player submits an invalid word THEN the bot SHALL reject it and maintain the current game state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the bot to validate my word submissions, so that only legitimate English words are accepted in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a word is submitted THEN the bot SHALL verify it exists in the English dictionary using NLTK or Wordnik API
2. WHEN a word fails validation THEN the bot SHALL inform the player the word is not valid
3. WHEN word validation fails THEN the bot SHALL allow the player to try again within their turn time
4. WHEN the validation service is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL inform players and pause the game

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want a time limit for each turn, so that the game maintains pace and doesn't stall indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player's turn begins THEN the bot SHALL start a 30-second countdown timer
2. WHEN the timer expires without a valid submission THEN the bot SHALL skip to the next player
3. WHEN a player submits a valid word before timeout THEN the bot SHALL cancel the timer
4. WHEN a turn times out THEN the bot SHALL announce the timeout and next player's turn
5. WHEN a turn times out THEN the bot SHALL maintain the current letter and word length requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear turn announcements, so that I know when it's my turn and what the current requirements are.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new turn begins THEN the bot SHALL announce "@username, please enter a word starting with X and length Y"
2. WHEN a player completes their turn THEN the bot SHALL immediately announce the next player's turn
3. WHEN announcing turns THEN the bot SHALL include the required starting letter and word length
4. WHEN a game starts THEN the bot SHALL establish and announce the player order
5. WHEN players join mid-game THEN the bot SHALL add them to the end of the turn queue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a group member, I want to check game status and stop games, so that I can understand the current state and end games when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends /status THEN the bot SHALL display current game state including active player, letter, and length
2. WHEN no game is active and /status is used THEN the bot SHALL inform users no game is running
3. WHEN a user sends /stopgame THEN the bot SHALL end the current game and clear all game state
4. WHEN /stopgame is used with no active game THEN the bot SHALL inform users no game is running
5. WHEN a game is stopped THEN the bot SHALL announce the game has ended to all participants

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot built with modern Python and telegram libraries, so that it's maintainable and uses current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is implemented THEN it SHALL use Python 3.10 or higher
2. WHEN the bot is implemented THEN it SHALL use the async version of python-telegram-bot library
3. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include a runnable main.py file
4. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include a requirements.txt with all dependencies
5. WHEN the bot runs THEN it SHALL handle multiple concurrent games in different group chats

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the gaming experience remains smooth and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all players leave the group during a game THEN the bot SHALL automatically end the game
2. WHEN a player leaves mid-game THEN the bot SHALL remove them from the turn queue and continue
3. WHEN only one player remains THEN the bot SHALL end the game and announce the winner
4. WHEN the bot restarts THEN it SHALL clear all previous game states
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the bot SHALL handle timeouts gracefully and inform players
